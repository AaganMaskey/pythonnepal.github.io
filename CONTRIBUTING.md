# Contributing

Want to contribute to the website? Here is how to get started.

## Setting up the site for local development

See section on "Setup for local development" in [README](https://github.com/PythonNepal/pythonnepal.github.io).

## Issues

[This](https://github.com/PythonNepal/pythonnepal.github.io/issues) is where all the issues and new requirements for the site are posted. This is a good place to start when you want to contribute. 

This is also where you can report issues yourself. If you find any issues with the website or have any new things to suggest, just open up an issue for it.

## Pull Requests

Once you have selected an Issue to solve, go ahead and write the code for that in your fork **on a separate branch** and send in a Pull Request. For more info about Pull Requests, visit [this](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) link.


We look forward to your contributions.
